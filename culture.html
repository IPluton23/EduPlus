         <h2>
            Viana do Castelo
         </h2>

         <img src="src/Cultural_Programme/viana.png" alt="Viana do Castelo">

         <p>
            A port city located in northern Portugal, in the Costa Verde region ("Green Coast") 
            at the mouth of the Lima River which flows into the Atlantic Ocean. 
            The beginnings of the city date back to ancient times, when a Celtic settlement was located on a hill 
            above the city of Monte de Santa Luzia (Saint Lucia Hill). Some time later it was conquered and occupied 
            by the Romans. The official date of foundation of Viana do Castelo is the year 1253. The founder of the 
            city was then the king of Portugal - Alfons III (1210-1279). 
            <br><br>
            Viana do Castelo experienced its greatest heyday 
             in the 16th century during great geographical discoveries. At that time, deep-sea ships were built in local 
            shipyards, and thanks to shipping, trade was also rapidly developing. The most important of them include 
            16thcentury Romanesque parish church (Igreja Matriz), 16th-century Paços do Concelho (former town hall), 
            16th-century Renaissance Queen's Fountain in the Republic Square (Chafariz da Praça da Rainha), 
            18th-century Church of Our Lady of Sorrows (Igreja da Senhora da Agonia ), designed by the famous French 
            architect Gustav Eiffel, an impressive iron bridge connecting Viana do Castelo with Santa Maria Maggiore, 
            the eighteenth century Palacio dos Tavoras and built in the years 1903-1943 and towering over the city 
            extremely picturesque monumental Lucia Sanctuary (Santuário de Santa Luzia). This temple was built on the 
            model of the Paris Basilica Sacré Coeur.
            <br><br>
            The city is famous for its unusual view extending from the windows of the local Temple, which was hailed by 
            National Geographic as one of the most beautiful views in the world

         <h2>
            Ponte de Lima
         </h2>

         <img src="src/Cultural_Programme/ponte.png" alt="Ponte de Lima">

         <p>
            A city in northern Portugal, located on the Lima River, about 28 km north-west of Braga. 
            Its origins date back to ancient times, when the Romans built a bridge here (Ponte Romana), 
            which was to be a stop on the route of an important trade route leading from Braga to Spanish 
            Astorga. Shortly thereafter, a small settlement formed around the crossing, which quickly developed 
            into a significant commercial center of the region. 
            <br><br>
            The city is known mainly for one of the largest 
            and most well-known markets in Portugal, organized every other Monday. A characteristic element of 
            the Ponte de Lima panorama is the Roman bridge leading to the old town, the landscape with an exotic 
            palm tree in the background. You can walk around this 277-meter-long, 4-meter-wide bridge closed to 
            cars, called Ponte Velha. We start the tour of the city from the main square of Largo de Camões 
            (directly at the bridge). The square has a 17th-century chafariz, i.e. a fountain. In the corner of 
            the square there is a remnant of the fourteenth-century defensive walls - Torre de São Paulo. 
            At Passeio 25 de Abril, a pedestrian street, there are numerous small shops with local products. 
            A walk to the south, along the Lima River, along the shady, plane-lined avenues of Avenida Dom Luis 
            Filipe, allows you to see the former convent of São Francisco and São António dos Capuchos. The building, 
            originally from the 16th century, now houses a museum of sacred art. On the other side of the bridge is 
            Igreja de Santo António, dating from the nineteenth century. The picturesque object, with a beautiful 
            tower, is often photographed, it blends in well with the palm tree and hills in the background.

         <h2>
            Porto   
         </h2>

      <img src="src/Cultural_Programme/porto.png" alt="Porto">

      <p>
         Porto is the second largest city of Portugal, in the opinion of many, completely different from Lisbon. It constantly 
         fights in the for the title of the most beautiful city of Portugal. Porto offers not only great architecture of the 
         center, interesting monuments, but also the world-famous Porto wine. 
         <br><br>
         There is an old saying in Portugal that says: 
         "They work in Porto, they pray in Braga, they study in Coimbra, and they spend money in Lisbon" - 
         it reflects the atmosphere of Porto, which is the most important city in northern Portugal, but we must not 
         forget that Porto offers also an innovative architecture that contrasts with the historic center and a number 
         of attractions that together make the city unique. There is no shortage of postcard views, because the city 
         lies on a hill and there is no problem to find a picturesque shot of the Douro River, which means "Golden" 
         in Portuguese. 
         <br><br>
         The place to start exploring is the Town Hall which dominates the northern end of Avienda 
         dos Aliados. It was built in 1920 and is one of the largest town halls in Europe with a 70 meter high 
         granite tower and an impressive clock. Going down the main street we pass the historic Estação de São 
         Bento Porto railway station on the left and a little further on the right side the Se Catedral do Porto. 
         Strolling along Rua de Augusto Rosa you can see the Funicular dos Guindais cable car. From the tunnel you 
         can see one of the most characteristic points of the city - the bridge of Louis I (Ponte de Dom Luís I), 
         which was designed by the engineer Théophil Seyrigow, who a few years earlier, together with Gustav Eiffel 
         designed the Ponte Dona Maria Pia bridge, which is also located in Porto. To see the best panorama we go 
         over the bridge towards Vila Nova de Gaia. Along the coast there are many benches where we can sit and 
         take a look at the river, admiring one of the most famous panoramas of Porto. You will see, among others 
         traditional wooden barges that were once used to transport wine down the river. It is worth going to the 
         magnificent church and tower of Clerigos - Igreja e Torre dos Clérigos - on Rua S. Filipe de Nery. Nearby 
         is the Universidade do Porto building, the famous Livraria Lello Bookshop Porto library together with the 
         magnificent Igreja do Carmo church, which is entirely decorated with Portuguese azulejos (ceramic tiles).
